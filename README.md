# fundslums

Earlier last month, I designed this project using figma for an hackathon I participated in, with a team of 2 developers.

Now that I've learnt more about frontend end, I coded out my design

Live site: https://psalmuel01.github.io/fundslums

Not yet mobile responsive, and no backend functionality here.

Fundslums is a charity website to help slum kids
